        Hi! My name is Hayden, I am an 18 year old transmasculine person who is currently studying web development. I've decided
        to make this website a place for people who are trans, nonbinary or questioning, to find helpful resources, positive
        messages, answers to questions, and positive pictures of the trans* community.
            <br /><br />
        I have done this because I see a great need in our community for resources that are easier to access,
        and prettier to look through. To me personally , it is really hard to read through information that looks like it
        was made decades ago, with no formatting or styling. I hope that this can be a place of positivity, learning and
          joy for everyone who visits this site.
            <br /><br />
        Please remember to be respectful to other users, and I hope you have a fabulous day!
            <br /><br /><br />
        Cheers,
        Hayden
