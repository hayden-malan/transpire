## Brief description of the project:


Transpire is an informative collection of resources, aimed to help educate people about the transgender community, and help store trans and nonbinary resources to be shared amongst the community. 

I saw a need for this because as a trans person, when I am online looking for information about these topics, I am discouraged by how hard it is to access this type of info, and how slow it is to hear about 1 good link to a resource page.

 Once you start reading this new link, it is also sometimes presented with minimal styling and very old looking html, which can make it hard to digest. 

My dream is that this project I have started, will grow into a useful app to help trans and nonbinary people as well as their loved ones, by providing them with a location on the web to easily access and read about trans resources, and eventually a place where people can add more resources to a growing database of links to sites with pre-existing info on those sites.

A central place for someone to start learning , if they have questions or interest or need info about anything related to being trans or a loved one being trans. Kind of like an information site or a map.

 ## User flow:
 
 --->>> A Home page! Be welcome! See a picture, and a quote, which update every so often and are ideally linked to respective picture and quote databases.
 
 --->>> A Nav Bar with Dropdowns
 *uses # routes for faster load times
 
In the navbar there are to be these buttons:
 
 HOME,
 RESOURCES,
 GALLERY,
 QUESTIONS,
 POSITIVITY
 
 and when you click on home,
 the dropdown will display
 GO HOME
 
 on resources,
 VIEW ALL,
 POST,
 SEARCH
 
 on questions,
 ASK,
 SEARCH,
 VIEW ALL
 
 on positivity,
 SEARCH,
 VIEW,
 POST
 
 Each item on a dropdown menu will take the user to the relevant page.

 ## MVP
  
 - HOME, RESOURCES, GALLERY buttons with their respective routes are working 
 -HOME has a GO HOME which sends the user back home no matter where they are
 
 -RESOURCES has 6 different working links that take you to VIEW ALL, and 5 specific data filtering pages.
 
 -GALLERY has a VIEW ALL 
 
 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
##Future goals:
 
 So, eventually, there would be an "add" and a "search" for resource links within the DB and maybe even social media links, a 'heart' button for any form of data the user likes.
