# FEATURES TO BE EXCITED ABOUT IN CURRENT 'version'

SO! Right now on my most updated branch, I have:

### Home page is working
### Nav Bar is looking COOL

### Routes are working using HashRouter

### There is a /resources page to theoretically View All
### All of the /resources/thing pages are linked to and have some filler text there, are waiting for data

### Haha uh, the CSS is pretty much done! (fingers crossed)
### The header and footer are nice and consistent and the links to github, tumblr and my shark quiz are working

# SOME TEXT ABOUT THE PROJECT OR SOMETHING

BUT before we start that, let's dig into some SOFT SKILLS:

## A THING ABOUT MY PROCESS OVER PRODUCT

Process Over Product: Trying to get myself into the growth mindset rather than the fixed mindset.

-I am scared of looking dumb >> I would like to acknowledge that at all times I have given my utmost effort, and have absorbed maximum learning from the things I've been doing.

-I can sometimes be so worried about looking smart that I will purposefully avoid tasks >> I would like to acknowledge that all times are a good learning opportunity, whether or not I look smart.

-I have sometimes thought that my ability will mean I won't have to have as much effort >> I am coming to realise that effort is what will then give me that ability, and there is no way around the initial effort of learning something new.

-I have been rather tempted to hide or run from my mistakes, both in my code, and in my project management process >> I am coming to understand that mistakes are a natural and vital part of learning.

-Sometimes I am very afraid to try new things that I am not confident with yet, in case I mess it up. Often this leads to me losing interest in doing the thing I am scared to do. >> I have been urging myself to try and embrace new challenges rather than shying away from them, and to have a sense of confidence not about the outcome but rather about my process.

-I have often been praised in the past for my ABILITY "you're so smart" >> I am working to change my internal dialogue, so that I can praise myself on my PROCESS and EFFORT rather than the results of what I am doing. "You really tried hard."

## OK SO NOW I AM LAUNCHING INTO MY INTRO, WHAT IS TRANSPIRE AND WHY DID I MAKE IT

Transpire is an informative collection of RESOURCES, aimed to help educate cis people about trans people, and help store trans and nb resources to be shared amongst the community. I saw a need for thi because as a trans person, when I am online looking for information about these topics, I am discouraged by how hard it is to access this type of info, and how slow it is to hear about 1 good link to a resource page. Once you start reading this new link, it is also sometimes presented with minimal styling and very old looking html, which can make it hard to digest. 

My dream is that this project I have started, will grow into a useful app to elp trans and nb people as well as their loved ones, by providing them with a location on the web to easily access and read about trans resources, and eventually a place where people can add more resources to a growing database of links to sites with pre-existing info on those sites.


ONE place for someone to START learning , if they have questions or interest or need info about antthing related to being trans or a loved one being trans. Kind of like an I site or a map.

## HERE'S A DIAGRAM OF HOW I WANT IT TO WORK

	Info Info Info Info Info
	|     |     |    |   |
	\     \     |    /   /
	 \     \    |    /   /
 you are here>> TRANSPIRE

 ## SO LIKE, WHAT IS THE USER EXPERIENCE? (the intended one anyway)
 
 --->>> A Home page! Be welcome! See a picture, and a quote, which update every so often and are ideally linked to respective picture and quote databases.
 
 --->>> A Nav Bar with Dropdowns
 *uses # routes for faster load times
 
 So what's in the nav bar? eventually I want these to be the buttons:
 
 HOME,
 RESOURCES,
 GALLERY,
 QUESTIONS,
 POSITIVITY
 
 and when you click on home,
 the dropdown will display
 GO HOME
 
 on resources,
 VIEW ALL,
 POST,
 SEARCH
 
 on questions,
 ASK,
 SEARCH,
 VIEW ALL
 
 on positivity,
 SEARCH,
 VIEW,
 POST
 
 Ideally all of these dropdowns would "do" something when clicked on.

 ## What's the MVP though?
 
 For me right now, the MVP would be that the 
 
 HOME,
 RESOURCES,
 GALLERY
 
 buttons with their respective routes are working,
 and that 
 
 HOME has a GO HOME which sends the user back home no matter where they are,
 
 RESOURCES has 6 different working links that take you to VIEW ALL, and 5 specific data filtering pages
 
 GALLERY has a VIEW ALL so that you can see what is happening over there!
 
 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 
 ## the rest is important to me but I think will be unattainable in the current timeframe and more like something to work on in the future.
 
 So, eventually, there would be an "add" and a "search" for resource links within the DB and maybe even social media links, a 'heart' button for any form of data the user likes, and more stuff!!
 
 Honestly tonight I'm too bloody tired to do all that. So here is to a brilliant idea and pitch 3 weeks in the making (accounting for terribly novice time management ~\_(^_^)_/~
