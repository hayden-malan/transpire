##Process Over Product:

Trying to get myself into the growth mindset rather than the fixed mindset.

-I am scared of looking dumb >> I would like to acknowledge that at all times I have given my utmost effort, and have absorbed maximum learning from the things I've been doing.

-I can sometimes be so worried about looking smart that I will purposefully avoid tasks >> I would like to acknowledge that all times are a good learning opportunity, whether or not I look smart.

-I have sometimes thought that my ability will mean I won't have to have as much effort >> I am coming to realise that effort is what will then give me that ability, and there is no way around the initial effort of learning something new.

-I have been rather tempted to hide or run from my mistakes, both in my code, and in my project management process >> I am coming to understand that mistakes are a natural and vital part of learning.

-Sometimes I am very afraid to try new things that I am not confident with yet, in case I mess it up. Often this leads to me losing interest in doing the thing I am scared to do. >> I have been urging myself to try and embrace new challenges rather than shying away from them, and to have a sense of confidence not about the outcome but rather about my process.

-I have often been praised in the past for my ABILITY "you're so smart" >> I am working to change my internal dialogue, so that I can praise myself on my PROCESS and EFFORT rather than the results of what I am doing. "You really tried hard."
